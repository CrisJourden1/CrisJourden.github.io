  - About Me and Why MIS?
---

My name is Cristina Jourden. Though born on the mainland, I`ve spent most of my life in South Korea and Oahu. 
Originally my major was Computer Science but chose to change Management Information System after speaking with a mentor.
He recommended MIS because while I find technology interesting, my real passion is working with people.
